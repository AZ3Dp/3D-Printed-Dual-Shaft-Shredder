# [Brief Log/Update] - 2025-12-22
So I assembled the gearbox that was integrated into the shredder. It "ran" (spinning the input gear would make the output gear spin), but the gears ended up cracking and breaking. I will attempt to combat this with a plethora of strategies!

## Future Notes & Ideas
Will a) reprint the gears with strong settings b) update and enhance the design c) get the gears manufactured in metal

# [Parametric Gearbox for Torque Multiplication] - 2025-12-20
## Added
A parametric simple gearbox was added so that the hand-crank could have more torque!

## Future Notes & Ideas
Almost done yay!

# [Tolerance Change] - 2025-12-01

## Changed
The anvil-rotor clearance between the blades (of one side) and the washers (of the other side) was lowered. This should help with shearing the material. This was attained by increasing the diameter of the washers.

## Future Notes & Ideas
I think it's about time to start publishing and sorting everything together.

# [CAD Fixes] - 2025-11-26

# [Some Brush-ups] - 2025-11-24
Made some modifications to the already "polished" 3D shredder. Looking to improve user experience during assembly
## Added
Front plate aluminum extrusion/mounting board mounting holes. This may/may not be applicable for the back plate, depending on the size of the gears.

Created a 1:1 Gear Ratio set (double helical gears, 10mm height, 2.6mm module, 20 teeth)

## Changed
Offset the 2020 aluminum extrusion (or base mounting) holes to be further out

## Fixed
Added 3D printing corner holes for the gears.

## Future Notes & Ideas
I will need to figure out how the aluminum extrusion and the shredder is assembled. Currently, the m5 allen key is getting jammed up by the hopper mounts.
