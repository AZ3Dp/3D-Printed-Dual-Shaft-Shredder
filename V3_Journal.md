# [Some Brush-ups] - 2025-11-24
Made some modifications to the already "polished" 3D shredder. Looking to improve user experience during assembly
## Added
Front plate aluminum extrusion/mounting board mounting holes. This may/may not be applicable for the back plate, depending on the size of the gears.

Created a 1:1 Gear Ratio set (double helical gears, 10mm height, 2.6mm module, 20 teeth)

## Changed
Offset the 2020 aluminum extrusion (or base mounting) holes to be further out

## Fixed
Added 3D printing corner holes for the gears.

## Future Notes & Ideas
I will need to figure out how the aluminum extrusion and the shredder is assembled. Currently, the m5 allen key is getting jammed up by the hopper mounts.
