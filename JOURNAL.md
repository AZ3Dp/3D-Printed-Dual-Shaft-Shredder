## 10/19/2025 - Planning the Dual Shaft Shredder

After doing some research, it seems that dual-shaft shredders will have an advantage over single-shaft shredders in the sense that dual-shaft shredders will give off smaller, more uniform shreds. However, the design of dual shaft shredders is more complex, since there are two shafts - twice as many moving parts (blades, washers, shafts), and the necesity to transmit the rotation using gears.
Some helpful sources mentioned how different gear ratios will enable better shearing, so I think I can make multiple gear configurations in CAD. (1:1 and 3:2 gear ratios)
