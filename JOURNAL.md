## 10/19/2025 - Planning the Dual Shaft Shredder  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQ2MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2177c6ecac91d23475ba764393fe4e02a9436e85/image.png)
After doing some research, it seems that dual-shaft shredders will have an advantage over single-shaft shredders in the sense that dual-shaft shredders will give off smaller, more uniform shreds. However, the design of dual shaft shredders is more complex, since there are two shafts - twice as many moving parts (blades, washers, shafts), and the necesity to transmit the rotation using gears.
Some helpful sources mentioned how different gear ratios will enable better shearing, so I think I can make multiple gear configurations in CAD. (1:1 and 3:2 gear ratios)
  

## 11/3/2025 - Created First Base

So I do have some experience from the first shredder I made, so this went by a lot faster. The base is built to be extra chunky to take advantage of 3D printing. I plan to manufacture this shredder with m3 screws and nuts instead of m5, since I believe that more smaller fasteners can be stronger than fewer, larger fasteners.
