## 10/19/2025 - Planning the Dual Shaft Shredder  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQ2MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2177c6ecac91d23475ba764393fe4e02a9436e85/image.png)
After doing some research, it seems that dual-shaft shredders will have an advantage over single-shaft shredders in the sense that dual-shaft shredders will give off smaller, more uniform shreds. However, the design of dual shaft shredders is more complex, since there are two shafts - twice as many moving parts (blades, washers, shafts), and the necesity to transmit the rotation using gears.
Some helpful sources mentioned how different gear ratios will enable better shearing, so I think I can make multiple gear configurations in CAD. (1:1 and 3:2 gear ratios)
  

## 11/3/2025 - Created First Base

So I do have some experience from the first shredder I made, so this went by a lot faster. The base is built to be extra chunky to take advantage of 3D printing. I plan to manufacture this shredder with m3 screws and nuts instead of m5, since I believe that more smaller fasteners can be stronger than fewer, larger fasteners.  

## 11/6/2025 - More CAD Work - Blades + Shaft + Gears

Today, I did some more modeling work on the dual shaft shredder. I created custom shaft collars to secure the shafts, and I also created herringbone gears. I also made the framework for the blades.  

## 11/9/2025 - Shredder Coming to Life

Did a lot of work in CAD, and the shredder seems to be getting closer and closer to the final goal! I decided to make the blades 5 toothed, a good balance of bite and grinding. I also modeled in the the hopper (safety first!). Lastly, I made the side wall blade cleaners. These should prevent the plastic from building up in between the blades.
